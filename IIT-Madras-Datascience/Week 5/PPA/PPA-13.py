""" The following expression is called a continued fraction:
                    x + 1/(x + 1/(x + 1/(x + 1/(x + 1/x))))
    Accept a positive integer x as input, compute the value of this continued fraction and store the result in a variable named cfrac.
    We will round off your answer to exactly two decimal places.
    You don't have to print the output to the console, we will take care of that."""



x = int(input())
cfrac = x + 1/(x + 1/(x + 1/(x + 1/(x + 1/x))))
