""" Write a program to realize the equation of a line given 2 points  ( x1 , y1 )  and  ( x2 , y2 )  in 2D space.
    The input is in 5 lines where, the first, second, third, and fourth lines represent  x1 , y1 , x2 , y2  respectively.
    The fifth line corresponds to  x3
    Determine  y3  using the equation of a straight line as given below:

              ( ( x - x1 ) / ( x2 - x1 ) ) = ( ( y - y1 ) / ( y2 - y1 ) )
 
   The output should be "Vertical Line" if the line is vertical. In other cases, the output should be 2 lined,
   where the first line is the value of  y3  and the second line indicates whether the slope of the line is positive, negative or zero.
   Print "Positive Slope", "Negative Slope" or "Horizontal Line" accordingly.

   Note that all inputs are to be processed as real numbers. """
